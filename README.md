# in this project i was supposed to create a table that is able to sort in ascending and descending order in each field

<!-- Final notes -->
# Well i started out with the logic for sorting the actual array once i got that done i moved onto trying to get pagination to work and could not for the life of me figure it out. I finally gave up and looked online for what i can do and then found a website with what i though i needed but i then could not figure out how to incorporate it on my code. I spent wayyyyyy to much time on that and didn't get design done so all i really got done was the logic for sorting but nothing is displayed and its all in the console. So basically i got nothing done :(
